    <h1>Asteroids in Java!: Part 1</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>This is a two part guide in creating the game Asteroids, in the programming language Java.</h4>
    <h4>Asteroids developed by Atari and self published in the year 1979 is a video game classic. The gameplay consists of the player steering a triangular spaceship, with the goal of destroying asteroids by shooting them.</h4>
    <h4>What follows is a larger scale example, where we create a part of the Asteroids game. The game is also an exercise in the course — write the game into the provided template (at the end of the example) by following the example.
    </h4>
    <h4>The game is constructed in multiple parts, which are the following:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#gameWindow">Creating the game window</a>
      </li>

      </li>

Let's create an event handler, which reacts to events on the keyboard. Keyboard events have an enumerated variable KeyCode, which tells us the key that was pressed. We are interested in the keys left (LEFT) and right (RIGHT).
    </h4>

    <h2>Turning the ship: Keyboard listener, part 2
    </h2>
    <h4>The previous approach enables a "kind of OK"-way to turn a node. There is an issue with the approach — the movement is not smooth. When the key is pressed, the ship rotates, then takes a short break, after which it continues rotating.
    </h4>
    <h4>This is related to how programs handle keyboard events by default. If the program would handle the keypress as multiple events immediately as the key is pressed, then, for example, writing text would become quite difficult, since even slightly longer keypresses would immediately generate multiple characters.
    </h4>
    <h4>Let's change the handling of keyboard event, such that we keep a record of pressed keys. This can be done, for example, using a hash table. The hash table contains the KeyCode object, i.e. the object representing the key, as the key and a Boolean variable as the value. If the value of the boolean variable of a particular key is true, then the key is pressed, otherwise the key is not pressed.
    </h4>
    <h4>Now we also consider depressing the key, i.e. the onKeyReleased event.
